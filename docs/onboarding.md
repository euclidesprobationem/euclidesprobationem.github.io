# On-Boarding

Welcome to the team! As a quick order of business, let's get you added to the website!

1) Install [git], create a [GitHub] account and request to join [BattModels]
2) Clone the website: `git clone https://github.com/euclidesprobationem/euclidesprobationem.github.io.git`
3) Open `_data/people.yml` in the newly created `group-website` folder
4) Add a small (<100 Kb) headshot here: `img/people/andrewid.png`
    - If your headshot is too large, try compressing it with an online tool
    - Aspect ratio should be 1:1 with the head centered in the image

5) Add an entry to the end of the appropriate section:
    - i.e. if you're a master's student, add your entry under `# masters`
    - Refer to [Entry Format](#entry-format) for the desired format

6) Commit and push your changes:
    - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b add_john_doe`
    - Add files to the staging area with `git add`
        - `git add _data/people.yml`
        - `git add img/people/andrewid.png`
    - Commit the staged changes: `git commit -m "Adding John Doe's Info"`
    - Push the commit to Githib with `git push -u origin add_john_doe`

7) Open a [pull request on Github][pr]
    - If this is your first commit, slack @awadell1 to approve running CI
    - If all checks pass, merge your pull request
    - Otherwise, try to [fix the issues](1) or [ask for help](2)

8) Congrats on making your first pull request in the group!
