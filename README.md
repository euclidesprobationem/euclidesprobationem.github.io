# Omega Proof Research Group

Thanks for the work of [template](https://github.com/BattModels/group-website), and their website originated from [this template](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web), of which this is no longer a fork so that we can have our own issues and pull requests. See bottom of this file for licensing info, etc.

(Blog actions like on-boarding new group member are well explained in README, thus no changes updated)

This README is a slightly modified, compressed, and reorganized version of the original from the template.
